# pybone

The trombone slide position optimizer, made in Python.

## How to use

Run the command:

```
python3 pybone.py -m [method] [notes...]
```

Using any of the following methods:

| Name | Description |
|---|---|
| distance (default) | Minimize total slide movement distance |
| direction | Minimize slide direction changes |
| gliss | Minimize partial changes to optimize for glissando |
| legato | Maximize partial changes to optimize for natural legato |

Each note should be written in scientific pitch notation, with a letter name, optionally followed by a sharp (`#`) or a flat (`b`), followed by an octave number.
